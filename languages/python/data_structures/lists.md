# notes on the list data structure in python, thank you google for making me do this research hahaha

* what is a [list in python](https://python.swaroopch.com/data_structures.html)?
	* a data structure that holds an ordered collection of items
		* a sequence of items

* how are [lists implemented in python](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/914233/what-is-the-underlying-data-structure-for-python-lists)?
	* list objects are implemeneted as arrays
		* optimized for fast fixed-length operations
		* incur O(n) memory movement costs for pop(0) and insert(0, v) operations which change both the size and position of the underlying data

* what are the [methods of the list object](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html)?
	* list.**append**(x)
