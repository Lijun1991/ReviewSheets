must find segfault. hahaha always assume null!!!

welp now i need to figure out the long print of ls. oh i did that already haha. 

build long format gooooooo.

* organizational
	* bitch to kwame about av
		* organize team
	* ad hoc for the doc for permissions rights
	* figure out some video editing process and approval process
	* get mentor team set up for los altos 
	* ask lou about the back of bocal

breaking up long printing. i can probably put permissions in one function, and have it apply to group, individual, and other. i can throw the entire options string into a function. i can do the rest inline except for the time stuff, and path stuff. both of those should be handled in seperate functions.

figured out why it was broken. of course i was passing it the file name instead of the file path. how is the computer going to know how to find the file if i don't tell it. duhhhhhh.

* shit on the horrizon
	* talk to jamie on monday 2/6 about the showcase event
	* work with freidrich on the av protocol stuff
	* talk with justin about mentor squad

keep long printing wooooooo.

so i can make a generalizable function that takes a bit shifting incrementer to do the work for all three pieces of information. the reason this is valuable is that i'm gonna have to norm this bitch, and i don't want to add an extra file.

figuring out time parsing

i figured out time parsing! woooooooo.

now i'm working on the column spacing. depending on the size of different properties of the contents of the directory, the spacing between columns will change. all of the spacing for each item will always match.

finished long printing :)

all that is theoritically left is handling arguments and handling reverse sort and time sort.
