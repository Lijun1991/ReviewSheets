### November 12th 2016 - working on printf

i've more or less figured out how i'm gonna parse the strings. hopefully it can be as recursive as i want it to be. looking forward to writing a summary after i see the feasability of the basics.

i imported the functions from my libft i think i will need to use in the project. This will hopefully make using it in conjunction with libft simpler and less brittle.
