i've been doing a lot of reasearch oriented stuff. this does not exactly add exciting sagas to the dev logs. this is something i should change. hmmmm. i guess i could write a little on my thoughts of the implications of something i researched during the day. that should add a little meat to these bones.

docker basically creates a nice interface over existing tools to simplify operating-system level virtualization. One thing i can see being super useful is the ability to have all the dependencies static within the container without interferring with one another. This means you wont have the problem where you try to upgrade a part of the system, and break the rest of it.

so this google foobar thing kind of changes everythin. now i'm going to end up interview ready, which means i might as well apply to a bunch of internships, which means that im changing my whole plan basically. so lets focus on today.

* today
	* talk to jamie
		* designathon
	* talk to john
		* the video
	* work on the markov chain problem
		* build a matrix library
			* exist
			* create identity matrix of arbritary size
			* re-arrange rows and columns
			* subset

			* matrix subtraction
			* matrix multiplication
			* inverse of matrix

	* build a docker container for the process on the server
		* not sure just start doing

okay i got the google foobar stuff under control. back to virtualization. so were going to use docker compose to manage the containers, dockerui to visualize the docker host. To pass a directory to a container i need to mount it to the container. passing arbritary arguments should be no big deal. really my next step should be to go throught the getting started compose thing, and just set up a docker image using compose. very likely that my questions will be answered in the process of doing that.
