# general notes on the field of probability theory, this one hurt google. it really hurt. im gonna need to learn a shit ton to get this done.

* what is [probability theory in the first place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory)?
	* a branch of mathematics concerned with probability
		* the analysis of random phenomena
	* the central objects of probability theory
		* random variables
		* stochastic processes
		* events
	* it is not possible to predict precisely results of random events
		* if a sequence of individual events is influenced by other factors
			* will exhibit certain patterns
				* can be studied and predicted
	* mathematical results describing patterns influenced by other factos 
		* law of large numbers
		* central limit theorem
	* the mathematical foundation for statistics
	* methods of probability theory apply to descriptions of complex systems given only partial knowledge of their state
		* statistical mechanics
	* this shit is completely over my head


* what are [random variables in the field of probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable)?
	* a variable quantity whosepossible value depend, in random manner, on a set of random outcomes events

* what are [events in the field of probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(probability_theory))?
	* a set of outcomes of an experiment to which a probability is assigned

* what is a [sample space in the field of probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_space)?
	* 

* what is an [experiment in the field of probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment_(probability_theory))?
	* any procedure that can be infinitely repeated and has a well defined set of possible outcomes, known as the sample space
		* random 
			* an experiment is random if it has more than one possible outcome
			* Bernoulli trial
				* a random experiment that has exactly two (mutually exclusive) possible outcomes
		* deterministic
			* an experiment is deterministic if it has only one outcome
