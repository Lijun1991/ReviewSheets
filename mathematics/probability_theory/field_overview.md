# general notes on the field of probability theory, this one hurt google. it really hurt. im gonna need to learn a shit ton to get this done.

* what is [probability theory in the first place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory)?
	* a branch of mathematics concerned with probability
		* the analysis of random phenomena
	* the central objects of probability theory
		* random variables
		* stochastic processes
		* events
	* it is not possible to predict precisely results of random events
		* if a sequence of individual events is influenced by other factors
			* will exhibit certain patterns
				* can be studied and predicted
	* mathematical results describing patterns influenced by other factos 
		* law of large numbers
		* central limit theorem
	* the mathematical foundation for statistics
	* methods of probability theory apply to descriptions of complex systems given only partial knowledge of their state
		* statistical mechanics
	* this shit is completely over my head


* what are [random variables in the field of probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable)?
	* a variable quantity whosepossible value depend, in random manner, on a set of random outcomes events

* what are [events in the field of probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_(probability_theory))?
	* a set of outcomes of an experiment to which a probability is assigned

* what is a [sample space in the field of probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_space)?
	* 

* what is an [experiment in the field of probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment_(probability_theory))?
	* any procedure that can be infinitely repeated and has a well defined set of possible outcomes, known as the sample space
		* random 
			* an experiment is random if it has more than one possible outcome
			* Bernoulli trial
				* a random experiment that has exactly two (mutually exclusive) possible outcomes
		* deterministic
			* an experiment is deterministic if it has only one outcome
	* after conducting many trials of the same experiment and pooling the results an experimenter can beging to assess the empirical probabilities of the various outcomes and events that can occur		
	* experiments and trials
		* random experiments are often conducted repeatedly
			* the collective results can be subjected to statistical analysis
		* composed experiment
			* fixed number of repetitions of the same experiment
		* trials
			* individual repetitions within an experiment
	* mathematical description
		* random experiments are modelled by a mathematical construct known as a probility space







* what are [empirical probabilities in the field of probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_probability)?
	* the empirical probability of an event is the ratio of the number of outcomes in which a specified event occurs to the total number of trials
		* not in a theoritical sample space but in an actual experiment
	* estimates probabilities from experience and observation


* what is [probability space in the context of probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_space)?
	* a mathematical constructs that model a real-world experiment or process consisting of states that occur randomly
		* constructed with a specific kind of sittuation or experiment in mind
	* one proposes that each time a situation of that kind arises
		* the set of possible outcomes is the same
		* the probabilities are also the same
	* probability space consist of three parts
		* Î©: sample space
			* the set of all possible outcomes
		* ![{\displaystyle {\mathcal {F}}} {\mathcal {F}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/205d4b91000d9dcf1a5bbabdfa6a8395fa60b676 "set of events"): set of events
			* each event is a set containing zero or more outcomes
		* 



* what are [outcomes in the field of probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_(probability))?
	* a possible result of an experiment
		* each possible outcome of a particular experiment is unique and different outcomes are mutually exclusive
	* all of the possible outcomes of an experiment form the elements of a sample space
