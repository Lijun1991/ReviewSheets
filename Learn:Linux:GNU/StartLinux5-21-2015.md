####Brushing up on history

**[Linus Benedict Torvalds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds)**: 
* Principle force behind development of the Linux kernel.
* Created git (distributed revision control system)
* Tux the penguin is his personal mascot and has been adopted to be the Linux kernel mascot by the community 
* He uses the Fedora distro 
* Look him up on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) interesting read

**[Richard Stallman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman)**: 
* Launched the GNU Project and founded the Free Software Foundation 
* Developed the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc), GNU Emacs, and GNU General Public Liscense
* I was to engrossed to take notes sorry.... hahaha look him up on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman)
* There is a bit of a naming contreversy on what to call this operating system, whether it be GNU/Linux, Linux/GNU, or Linux
	* GNU has a [FAQ on their perspective](http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html)
* [Stallman's take](http://www.gnu.org/gnu/why-gnu-linux.html) on why to call it GNU/Linux
 
**[GNU General Public License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License)**:
* Most widely used free software license which gurantees end users the freedoms to use, study, share, and modify the software
* Includes [Copyleft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft) = Any derived work can only be distributed under the same license terms
* Look this up on [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) too really interesting 

**[Free Software Foundation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)**:
* 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded by Richard Stallman to support the free software movement 
* Basically a non-profit to promote and finance all aspects of the free software movement, if you digested the other wiki's this is less interesting
* The [Free Software Foundation has a website](http://www.fsf.org/)
* The [GNU also has a website](http://www.gnu.org/), i'm including them here because from a novices perspective they seem rather tied together
